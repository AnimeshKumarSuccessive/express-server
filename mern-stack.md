1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database 
MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).

Why use MongoDB? 

Fast – Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore a faster response.
Scalability – Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.
Use of JavaScript – MongoDB uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.
Schema Less – Any type of data in a separate document.
Data stored in the form of JSON –
Objects, Object Members, Arrays, Values, and Strings
JSON syntax is very easy to use.
JSON has a wide range of browser compatibility.
Sharing Data: Data of any size and type(video, audio) can be shared easily.
Simple Environment Setup – Its really simple to set up MongoDB.
Flexible Document Model – MongoDB supports document-model(tables, schemas, columns & SQL) which is faster and easier.

2. Express: Back-End Framework: 
Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs. Express supports many middlewares which makes the code shorter and easier to write.

Asynchronous and Single-threaded.
Effecient, fast & scalable
Has the biggest community for Node.js
Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.
Robust API
Create a new folder to start your express project and type below command in the command prompt to initialize a package.json file. Accept the default settings and continue. 

3. React: Front-End Library 
React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript and create UI components. 

Why use React? 

Virtual DOM – A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the original DOM. Any modification in the web application causes the entire UI to re-render the virtual DOM. Then the difference between the original DOM and this virtual DOM is compared and the changes are made accordingly to the original DOM.
JSX – Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React. Makes it easier and simpler to write React components.
Components – ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI. These components also promote code reusability and make the overall web application easier to understand.
High Performance – Features like Virtual DOM, JSX and Components makes it much faster than the rest of the frameworks out there.
Developing Android/Ios Apps – With React Native you can easily code Android-based or IOS-Based apps with just the knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS.
You can start your react application by first installing “create-react-app” using npm or yarn.
